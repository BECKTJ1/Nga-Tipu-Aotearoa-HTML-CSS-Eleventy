## Enhanced flora search feature

Our flora search now has an enhanced feature which suggests possible scientific name matches when you begin to type in a word in the Flora Search. For example, if you wish to search for Corynocarpus laevigatus you can begin typing the first part of this name and the system will find twenty closely matching scientific names, continue typing and the matches will become more specific. You can choose to click on these suggested matches and go straight to the species fact sheet. This new function sits alongside the previous search system which you can still use, ie. type in the plant name (common or scientific) and hit ‘Enter’ or click search ‘Search’ and the system will return several results for you to browse through or it may suggest possible alternatives if your search returns no exact match is found.

Another way to use this new search function is to put in the first part of the genus and first part of the species epithet with a space between, for example ‘cor aus’ will return Cordyline australis.
