## Methodology
The survey has been grouped into six topic areas and a separate automated survey form is available for each area. The six topic areas which we are seeking information on actual costs as they relate to restoration of native forest ecosystems are:

- Enrichment planting
- Remnant management
- Animal pest control
- Plant pest control

Also, the more people who are able to contribue to this survey the better – so please, if you can recommend people that have experience in these areas that might be willing to particpate in this survey please do so Survey responses are automatically anonymised.
