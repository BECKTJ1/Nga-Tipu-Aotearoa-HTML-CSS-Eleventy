<h2>Kauri were prolific in the past</h2>
<p>Kauri forests once covered 1.2 million ha from the Far North of Northland to Te Kauri, near Kawhia and were common when the first people arrived around 1,000 years ago.</p>
<h2>Past uses of kauri</h2>
<p>Māori used kauri timber for boat building, carving and building houses. The gum was used as a fire starter and for chewing (after it had been soaked in water and mixed with the milk of the puha plant).</p>
<p>The arrival of European settlers in the 1700s to 1800s saw the decimation of these magnificent forests. Sailors quickly realised the trunks of young kauri were ideal for ships' masts and spars, and the settlers who followed felled the mature trees to yielded huge quantities of sawn timber of unsurpassed quality for building.</p>
<p>The gum too, became essential in the manufacture of varnishes and other resin-based products. The gum was obtained through digging, fossicking in treetops, or more drastically, by bleeding live trees.</p>
<p>More forest was cleared as demand for farmland and timber increased in the early and mid 20th century.</p>
<h2>Pressure to protect kauri forests</h2>

</figure>
<p>There are calls for a national park comprising all the substantial scattered remnants of kauri forest. Adolescent trees have straight pole trunks and a distinctive narrow conical crown. As the trees mature the trunk thickens and the lower branches are shed, resulting in the clean, straight trunk of the adult kauri.</p>
<p>Kauri forests are home to many other trees and plants including taraire, kohekohe, towai, Kirk’s pine, toatoa, tanekaha and rata, and a diverse understory of shrubs and other plants. In fact, because kauri live so long and their leaves are high in tannins, they modify the soil they live on, and create specialised habitats such as gumlands.</p>
<h2>Saved from destruction</h2>
<p>The Waipoua forests of Northland were at first saved from destruction by their remoteness. The land was purchased by the Crown in 1876, but for decades there was debate over what should be done with the forest. Public pressure for total protection increased after the turn of the century, although in the 1940s kauri was logged for wartime boat building supplies.</p>
<p>In 1952 the 9,105 hectare Waipoua Sanctuary was finally declared, with all remaining kauri forests in Crown lands coming under the protection of the Department of Conservation by 1987. Kauri trees on private land are now also largely protected.</p>
<h2>Creating secure environments</h2>
<p>Waipoua is home to Tane Mahuta, king of the forest and the largest remaining kauri tree in the country. The 1,500 year old Tane Mahuta is 51.5 m tall, with a girth of 13.77 m.</p>
<p>The forests of Waipoua are vitally important refuges for threatened wildlife. The endangered North Island kokako and the North Island brown kiwi both live here. More abundant are the kukupa/kereru (New Zealand wood pigeon), fantail, pied tit, tui, grey warbler, shining cuckoo and kingfisher. Another distinctive creature is the large and very handsome kauri snail, a carnivore which feeds mainly on earthworms, slugs and soft-bodied insects.</p>
<p>A lasting reminder of the once-thriving kauri industry are the kauri dams. Kauri driving dams were built by loggers to drive large quantities of kauri logs downstream from remote areas. While they played a major role in the destruction of the forest, they were also impressive engineering feats, built without drawings or detailed calculations, yet able to withstand the pressure of tonnes of water and kauri logs which were swept through with tremendous force when the dam was tripped.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/coromandel/places/coromandel-forest-park/kauaeranga-valley/">Kauaeranga Valley</a> on the Coromandel, kauri was logged extensively for over 50 years with more than 60 dams built. In 1970 remaining areas of surviving forest were deemed protected as part of the Coromandel Forest Park.</p>
<p>The Kaiaraara Dam on Great Barrier Island (40 m wide and 14 m high), is one of the largest of 3,000 kauri dams built in New Zealand in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<h2>Kauri dieback</h2>
<p>Now kauri are facing a new threat. Kauri dieback is a fungus-type disease, Phytophthora agathidicida (PA), which is having a devastating effect on New Zealand’s kauri forests in Northland, Great Barrier Island and, potentially, the Coromandel Peninsula.</p>
<p>There is no known cure for kauri dieback, but we can help reduce its spread by cleaning boots and equipment and avoiding kauri tree roots. Any movement of soil around the roots of trees could spread the disease.</p>
<p>DOC, iwi, regional councils, MPI and local communities are working together to protect our kauri forests through the ‘Kia Toitu He Kauri – Keep Kauri Standing’ programme.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/pests-and-threats/diseases/kauri-dieback/">Kauri Dieback Recreation</a> Project aims to control the human spread of the disease on public conservation land.</p>

              <p class="plantpage__card__desc__intro">Beech forests are the largest remaining indigenous forest type in New Zealand, mainly because beech forests are found on mountainous land not generally regarded as the best for agriculture.</p>

                <h4 class="plantpage__card__desc__h4">Quick facts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A bit less than a quarter of New Zealand is still covered in native forest (6.4 million ha)</li>
                    <li>Of these forests, about two thirds have some beech in them (4 million ha)</li>
                    <li>About half of these have almost nothing but beech trees (2 million ha)</li>
                    <li>Beech trees can produce millions of seeds, and during a heavy seed fall about 50 million seeds (about 250 kg of seeds) will fall per hectare.

                <h4 class="plantpage__card__desc__h4">Beech species</h4>
                <p>New Zealand has five species of beech, each prefer different soil and climate conditions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Hard Beech</b> <em>(Fuscospora truncata)</em> and <b>black beech</b> <em>(Fuscospora solandri)</em> are found in the lowland areas of the North Island and northern South Island.</li>
                    <li><b>Red beech</b> <em>(Fuscospora fusca)</em> prefers the foothills and inland river valley floors particularly where soils are fertile and well drained. <b>Silver beech</b> <em>(Lophozonia menziesii)</em> prefers higher, wetter conditions.</li>
                    <li><b>Silver beech</b> is the most widespread tall tree in Fiordland.</li>
                    <li><b>Mountain beech</b> <em>(Fuscospora cliffortioides)</em> grows in the mountains and on less fertile soils than silver beech, often forming the tree line at high altitudes.</li>

      The Plant Names Database lists over 46,000 names and is a primary source of information for Ngā Tipu o Aotearoa - New Zealand Plants. The purpose of the New Zealand Plant Names Database is to provide an authoritative record of the scientific names, taxonomic concepts (i.e., synonymies), and biostatus for the lichens, liverworts, mosses, ferns, freshwater algae and seed plants in New Zealand. It also records the associated literature, vernacular and Māori names, as well as recently published keys and descriptions for some taxa. Editorial work on the Plant Names Database is ongoing and as new treatments, taxa and naturalisations are published these are added to the database.
