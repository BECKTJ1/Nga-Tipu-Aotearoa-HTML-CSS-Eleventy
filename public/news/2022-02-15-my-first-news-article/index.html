        <h2>Enhanced flora search feature</h2>
<p>Our flora search now has an enhanced feature which suggests possible scientific name matches when you begin to type in a word in the Flora Search. For example, if you wish to search for Corynocarpus laevigatus you can begin typing the first part of this name and the system will find twenty closely matching scientific names, continue typing and the matches will become more specific. You can choose to click on these suggested matches and go straight to the species fact sheet. This new function sits alongside the previous search system which you can still use, ie. type in the plant name (common or scientific) and hit ‘Enter’ or click search ‘Search’ and the system will return several results for you to browse through or it may suggest possible alternatives if your search returns no exact match is found.</p>
<p>Another way to use this new search function is to put in the first part of the genus and first part of the species epithet with a space between, for example ‘cor aus’ will return Cordyline australis.</p>

    <p>
      The Plant Names Database lists over 46,000 names and is a primary source of information for Ngā Tipu o Aotearoa - New Zealand Plants. The purpose of the New Zealand Plant Names Database is to provide an authoritative record of the scientific names, taxonomic concepts (i.e., synonymies), and biostatus for the lichens, liverworts, mosses, ferns, freshwater algae and seed plants in New Zealand. It also records the associated literature, vernacular and Māori names, as well as recently published keys and descriptions for some taxa. Editorial work on the Plant Names Database is ongoing and as new treatments, taxa and naturalisations are published these are added to the database.
