                <h3 class="plantpage__card__desc__h3">Why?</h3>
                
                <p class="plantpage__card__desc__intro">The Health factor, a plant-based diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, grains, beans, legumes and nuts, is rich in fiber, vitamins and other nutrients. And people who don't eat meat — vegetarians — generally eat fewer calories and less fat, weigh less, and have a lower risk of heart disease than nonvegetarians do.

                  Even reducing meat intake has a protective effect. Research shows that people who eat red meat are at an increased risk of death from heart disease, stroke or diabetes. Processed meats also increase the risk of death from these diseases. And what you don't eat can also harm your health. Diets low in nuts, seeds, seafood, fruits and vegetables also increase the risk of death</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3 class="plantpage__card__desc__h3">What?</h3>
                
                <p class="plantpage__card__desc__intro">A meat option or meat substitute (additionally called plant-based meat or phony meat, once in a while disparagingly) is a food item produced using veggie lover or vegetarian fixings, eaten as a swap for meat. Meat choices commonly rough characteristics of explicit kinds of meat, for example, mouthfeel, flavor, appearance, or compound attributes. </p>
        

                <h3 class="plantpage__card__desc__h3">Where?</h3>
                
                <p class="plantpage__card__desc__intro">There are many planted based items on the market you can buy them from Supermarkets such as Countdown, New world and Paknsave. To Support local produce you can check that your fruit and veg are locally sources which should be displayed on the item. Other means of getting local produce you can visit your local market, for example the Dunedin farmers market which is held in the mornings of every Saturday</p>
